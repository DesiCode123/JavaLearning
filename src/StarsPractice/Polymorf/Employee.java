     * If the parent class has multiple constructors and you want to direct to a
     * particular constructor, use the super() method.
     * The super() method should be the first line in your constructor.
     *
     * super(), super, this(), this:
     * - super() calls the superclass constructor.
     * - super refers to the superclasses instance variables.
     * - this() calls the current class constructor.
     * - this refers to the current class's instance variables.
     *
     * In every default constructor of a child class, by default, the super() method will be called,
     * pointing to the default constructor of the parent class
     *
     * Every default ore parameterize constructor of child class by default, the super() method will be called,
     * pointing to the default constructor of the parent clas
     *
     * Using constructor chaining that is buy using super method i can pas the values of instance variables from child clas to parents clas.
